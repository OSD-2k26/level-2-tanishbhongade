# 🧩 LEVEL 3 

Two paths split from the same root.

One bends to the **left**.  
One bends to the **right**.

Both must exist, or the road collapses.

---

The truth is not shared.
Only **one path** may carry the mark.

The mark has a simple name.
It ends with `.txt`
And it reveals the flag.

Choose carefully.

## 🧠 The Clue

The correct path is **not the one you are on now**.

Follow the path that is **chosen, not default**.
